# Overview
 
- aletsch-simple provides a simple set-up for an advance-retreat simulation of the largest glacier of the European Alps -- Aletsch Glacier, Switzerland -- using a simple parametrization of the mass balance based on time-varying Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELA), as well as an example of a fully-customized mass balance routine implementing an oscillating ELA.

- cluster-simple is similar to aletsch-simple, but over a wider domain including tens of glaciers to demonstrate the capability of IGM to model a glacier network.
 
- aletsch-1880-2100 gives the set-up to reproduce the [simulations](https://jouvetg.github.io/the-aletsch-glacier-module) of the Great Aletsch Glacier (Switzerland) in the [past](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/modelling-the-retreat-of-grosser-aletschgletscher-switzerland-in-a-changing-climate/C877413079F73C5FC6131FC7BC031B69) and in the [future](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/future-retreat-of-great-aletsch-glacier/EB46DC696E0AB9528168F42595EE23D9) based on the CH2018 climate scenarios and an accumulation/melt model.

- paleo-alps consits of a simple set-up to run a paleo glacier model in the European Alps in paleo times with different catchements (lyon, ticino, rhine, linth glaciers) with IGM around the last glacial maximum (LGM, about 24 BP in the Alps).

- aletsch-invert gives an example of data assimilation with IGM (paper and documentation to appear soon)

- mer-de-glace gives a combined example of inverse and forward modelling for the Mer de Glace Glacier in France.
